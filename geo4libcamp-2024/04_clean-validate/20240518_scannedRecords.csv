Access to computers and the Internet, along with the skills to use these tools is critical as technology becomes more and more a part of our daily lives and is integrated in our economic, educational, health, and workforce systems. The results will inform priorities for the City's digital inclusion initiatives, and help engage businesses, neighborhood and community groups, public sector partners, and funders to more effectively address community technology and economic development needs. In addition, the survey provides data to measure changes in the community over time. The City of Minneapolis Information Technology Department contracted with National Research Center, Inc. (NRC) to conduct a survey of residents to inform the City's efforts to overcome the digital equity gap between individuals and groups in their access to and use and knowledge of information and communication technologies. This is the third iteration of the Minneapolis Community Technology Survey; the first was conducted in 2012 and the second in 2013.Summary of Data Fields:Field 1 - Overall percentage of respondents who have lived in Minneapolis for 5 years or less by community and user levelField 2 - Overall percentage of foreign-born respondents by community and user levelField 3 - Overall percentage of respondents who rent their homes by community and user levelField 4 - Overall percentage of respondents who live in attached homes by community and user levelField 5 - Overall percentage of respondents living in households with three or more people by community and user levelField 6 - Overall percentage of respondents living in households with children under the age of 18 by community and user levelField 7 - Overall percentage of female respondents by community and user levelField 8 - Overall percentage of respondents aged 55 years or older by community and user levelField 9 - Overall percentage of respondents who are hispanic and/or any race other than white by community and user levelField 10 - Overall percentage of respondents who prefer to speak a language other than English at home by community and user levelField 11 - Overall percentage of respondents having annual household incomes of less than $50,000 by community and user levelField 12 - Overall percentage of respondents who do not work full- or part-time by community and user level Field 13 - Overall percentage of respondents who do not have a 4-year degree by community and user level Full data set (Raw data and data dictionary in Excel format) The workbook has two tabs, the first is the data dictionary that is needed to translate the data; the second is the raw data.

Each sample is collected over a period of 72-hours. The exact dates of collection are not specified on this dataset.Can ID -A unique identifier for this sample and is determined by concatenating the collecting Summa canister's identification number with the month and year of collection.Parameter -The chemical (for this study, all are Volatile Organic Compounds, or VOCs) for which the result is reported.Results -The amount of the particular VOC (parameter) detected in this sample. All results above the detection limit are reported in this dataset.Units -The units in which the result is reported. All results are reported in units of micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m3).CAS -The CAS Registry Number, also referred to as CASRN or CAS Number, is a unique numerical identifier assigned by Chemical Abstracts Service to every chemical substance described in the open scientific literature.HRV -A Health Risk Value (HRV) is the concentration of a chemical that is likely to pose little or no risk to human health and is being used by our study as a reference level for comparing the results. Most HRVs are expressed as concentrations of micrograms of chemical per cubic meter of air (µg/m3). HRVs are developed to protect human health for a specified length of exposure (e.g., one hour, 13 weeks, a lifetime). In cases where an HRV promulgated using the public process described in the Administrative Procedures Act (Minnesota Statutes Chapter 14) was not available as a reference level, we instead used the recommended exposure limit (REL) from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) or the permissible exposure limit (PEL) from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), selecting the most conservative level. For purposes of our study, all reference levels (HRVs, RELs, and PELs) will be referred to as a Health Risk Value.Units -The units associated with the HRV, REL, or PEL reference level. All reference levels have been converted to units of micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m3).HRV Types -The type (HRV, REL, or PEL) of reference level selected. For the purpose of this study, all are referred to as a Health Risk Value. The value selected was the lowest, most conservative value.Name -The name of the location. Volunteer names and business names are left blank.Description -The type of location where the canister was placed. Volunteer locations are typically residential sites where the property owner/occupant hosts a sampling Summa canister. Business locations, which are also VOC emitters, who are voluntarily participating in the study.

Future Mississippi River Corridor Critical Area Overlay Zoning [Minnesota--Saint Paul],Future Mississippi River Corridor Critical Area Overlay Zoning,"The Mississippi River Corridor Critical Area (MRCCA) districts shown in this layer will NOT applyto Saint Paul until Saint Paul updates its zoning code to conform to the new state rules, a process tentatively expected to be completed in the coming year. This text will be updated at the time the rules are put into effect. In the meantime, a companion layer of the Mississippi River Corridor Critical Area Overlay Districts can be found wherever this layer is found, and the districts in that layer are the ones which are currently applicable within the Mississippi River Corridor Critical Area.This data delineates the Mississippi River Corridor Critical Area (MRCCA) districts as provided inMinnesota Rules, part 6106.0100, subp. 9. The MRCCA is a land corridor along the Mississippi River in the seven-county metro area in which special land use regulations guide development activity. The corridor extends 72 miles along the Mississippi River from the cities of Ramsey and Dayton in the north to the City of Hastings and Ravenna Township in the south. It includes 54,000 acres of land along both sides of the river. The State of Minnesota created the corridor and land use regulations in 1976. Local governments administer the regulations through their local plans and zoning ordinances.The MRCCA is home to a full range of residential neighborhoods and parks, as well as river-related commerce, industry, and transportation.

These districts were created to regulate signage in a more specific way than what is provided in the existing zoning code.

Of note, several of the districts (Merriam Park, Snelling-Hamline and North End/South Como) follow old planning district boundaries that are no longer current.

Mississippi River Corridor Critical Area Overlay Zoning [Minnesota--Saint Paul],Mississippi River Corridor Critical Area Overlay Zoning,"This data delineates the districts set forth inChapter 68 of Saint Paul City Code, focused on the Mississippi River Corridor Critical Area (MRCCA). Chapter 68 also currently contains floodplain standards which are technically still binding, but have been functionally replaced by the standards set forth in Chapter 72,Floodplain Management Overlay Districts. The River Corridor Overlay District and its subclassifications, RC1, RC2, RC3, RC4, are map overlay districts, designed to provide comprehensive floodplain and river bluff management for the city in accordance with the policies of Minnesota Statutes (Chapters 103 and 116G), Minnesota Regulations (MEQC 54) and Governor's Executive Order No. 79-19.The MRCCA is a land corridor along the Mississippi River in the seven-county metro area in which special land use regulations guide development activity. The corridor extends 72 miles along the Mississippi River from the cities of Ramsey and Dayton in the north to the City of Hastings and Ravenna Township in the south. It includes 54,000 acres of land along both sides of the river. The State of Minnesota created the corridor and land use regulations in 1976. Local governments administer the regulations through their local plans and zoning ordinances.The MRCCA is home to a full range of residential neighborhoods and parks, as well as river-related commerce, industry, and transportation. Though the MRCCA has been extensively developed, many intact and remnant natural areas remain, including bluffs, islands, foodplains, wetlands, riparian zones, and native aquatic and terrestrial flora and fauna.New rules regulating the MRCCAwere published on December 27, 2016 and became effective January 4, 2017. Those new rules and these districts will not apply to Saint Paul until Saint Paul updates its zoning code to conform to the new state rules, which has not been initiated as of April 2018, a process which will take many months to complete.

District Councils [Minnesota--Saint Paul],District Councils,"Saint Paul has had a formal structure of neighborhood organizations to engage residents and collaborate with city government since 1975--one of the first in the nation.These organizations are known as district councils because they are resident groups thatengage and represent the people living in one of the city's 17 planning districts.Each district council is a 501(c)(3) non-profitwith a voluntary board of directors composed of members elected by their neighbors. The district council structure was formed as part of the development of the city's Citizen Participation Program, now known as the Community Engagement Program. The purpose of this program is to create opportunities for residents to learn about what is happening in their neighborhoods and collaborate with one another and city government to maintain and improve the quality of life in neighborhoods. The program includes funding allocated to each district council on a formula basis, technical assistance from city planners and other city staff regarding issues that are important to the neighborhood and non-profit management assistance from the city's Community Engagement Coordinator.District councils each are involved in work to improve the physical, social and economic structures in their neighborhood. The activity common to all district councils is the development of adistrict plan (sometimes referred to as a neighborhood plan) that is reviewed by the Planning Commission, CityCouncil and the Metropolitan Council--the region'smetropolitanplanning organization--before being adopted as part of the city's Comprehensive Plan. The Comprehensive Plan is a key tool used by the city to guide law-making and budgeting. District plans are an opportunity for residents to influence how those laws and budgets impact their neighborhoods. Along with this critical planning work,district councils may also be involved in:Reviewing community development proposalsAdvocating for park andrecreation center improvementsCoordinating community gardens and neighborhood beautification projectsPromoting environmental action through volunteering and advocacyOrganizing block clubs and working with the police department and other city agencies to improve public safetyDistrict councils rely on community-building activities and events as the basis for convening residents to become involved in their neighborhood. These include neighborhood forums, festivals, parades and block parties.A commitment to equity is foundational to successful community engagement. In 2017, the district councils proposed a change to the Community Engagement Program's Innovation Fund that was adopted in 2018. The fund is now divided equally among the 17 district councils to promote equitable practices and neighborhood outcomes. The goals of this program are:District council staff and volunteers more accurately reflect the communities they serve.District councils review and adopt policies and practices that intentionally create space for residents who are currently under-represented.District councils pursue systemic work that reflects the needs and priorities of residents who have been historically under-represented.Additionally, district council staff are required to participate in a peer support/best practices network composed of district councils or similar grassroots, place-based organizations in the region.",eng,"This dataset was automatically cataloged from the provider's ArcGIS Hub.

The data originates from two sources: the City's permitting system, and from the City's records on housing affordability. The dataset helps provide a deeper understanding of trends in market rate and affordable housing production.For the purposes of this dataset, the delineation of ""affordable units"" is tied to the construction of the new units: does the project — its development financing or the regulatory framework under which it was built — require units be affordable upon the completion of construction? This definition of affordability does not include units that are affordable only because of a post-construction subsidy or other similar subsequent commitment to affordability, such as through the city's Rental Rehab Loan Program or 4d Affordable Housing Incentive Program. It does, however, include units that are affordable under the terms of zoning district-based density bonuses for affordability. Projects built under a zoning-based density bonus currently comprise a very small portion of the larger total, and are identified in the Notes column of the associated table.This dataset will be updated quarterly, given the manual work currently involved in bringing it up-to-date. It is the product of work over five years across three City departments.Field definitions are available on this item information page for the individual Housing production layer. In addition to being available for download through the Open Information website, this data is perhaps more easily accessible in an interactiveHousing Production Dashboard.This data is designed under a methodology specific to the City of Saint Paul. Other government entities use the same originating permit data, but somewhat divergent methodologies, which can produce very different results. We believe this particular methodology gives the fullest and most timely depiction of housing production available. For specific details, see the ""Methodologies Compared"" tab at the bottom of theHousing Production Dashboard.",eng,"This dataset was automatically cataloged from the provider's ArcGIS Hub.

HRA Owned Sites for Redevelopment [Minnesota--Saint Paul],HRA Owned Sites for Redevelopment,"Attributes (Fields) Defined:Site Name: A name for the site. Each parcel is part of a site. Sites are an assemblage of one or more parcels that generally share geographic proximity and are marketed together as a unit. Many sites are just one parcel, but when they are more than one parcel, the parcel name (above) reflects this. Parcels within a site will share the same basic name, but be differentiated by a ""#1"", ""#2"", ""#3"", etc. appended to the end of the parcel name. The site name is the parcel name without the numbering at the end. In this way, in ArcGIS, a dissolve on the site name field can be run to produce an analysis by site, instead of by parcel.Alternate Site Names: Names that have been commonly used for the site, beyond the name specified in the ""Site Name"" field.Address: An address for a site shared by all parcels that comprise a site. This is derived from one of the parcel addresses for parcels that comprise the site, or from the addresses assigned by Public Works within a parcel, as can be seen in AMANDA or the PED Staff Map. If all parcel addresses have a street number of ""0"" because they are vacant, this field is to include a rough description of where the site is located in the city.Alternate Site Addresses: Additional addresses used to describe the site.
